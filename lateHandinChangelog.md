# Changes for an improved grade in DH2642

## Nicer frontpage

Added a background image to the intro page. Made the text prettier

## Heart animation

Added a little animation when books are added to favorites or if a book is rendered that is already favorited

## Fix loading spinner

Loading spinner was to close to the header above it. This was the case for multiple spinner locations.

Centered the header and moved it a bit further from the headers.

## Fix mobile responsivenes

The mobile search results were not responsive enough. Fixed that so you always see just one book per column on mobile

Also fixed mobile look on profile and reading list page

## Project feedback

Congratulations on finishing your project. Your current grade is the one reported, however there is still possibility for improving it, if you want to. 

The main reasons your project did not reach a higher grade were: 

- Not enough frontend complexity
  - Add some more advanded UI features, an example could be drag-n-drop functionality
- Some minor bugs with usage and UI. Make sure to test thoroughly and on several browsers

If you want to raise your grade, fix these problems and then submit again and notify Filip Kis or Christian Bogdan by e-mail.
